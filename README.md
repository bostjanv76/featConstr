# Explainable Feature Construction (EFC)
We present a novel method for efficient constructive induction. The method significantly speeds up the process of learning new, powerful features for predictive modelling and improves prediction performance by reducing the search space, coins a novel approach to using instance explanations for feature construction. The proposed feature construction method contributes to more successful and more comprehensible prediction models, which are becoming an important part of scientific, industrial, and societal processes.
