# Explainable Feature Construction (EFC)
We present a novel method for efficient constructive induction. The method significantly speeds up the process of learning new, powerful features for predictive modelling and improves prediction performance by reducing the search space, coins a novel approach to using instance explanations for feature construction. The proposed feature construction method contributes to more successful and more comprehensible prediction models, which are becoming an important part of scientific, industrial, and societal processes. 

The proposed EFC method consist of the following four steps:
1.	Explanation of a model predictions for individual instances.
2.	Identification of groups of attributes that commonly appear together in explanations.
3.	Efficient creation of constructs from the identified groups.
4.	Evaluation of constructs and selection of the best as new features.
